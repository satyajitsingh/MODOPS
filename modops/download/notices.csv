UK nuclear policymakers will be confronted with an array of challenges in the coming decades, including from major nuclear armed states, emerging nuclear states and state-sponsored nuclear terrorism. The complexity and breadth of these challenges requires the UK to consider how to adapt its approach to deterrence across the spectrum of conflict, including nuclear and strategic deterrence. This, in turn, requires an intellectual capability that can assist UK policymakers in understanding the new security dynamic and its implications for future deterrence requirements.  

The MoD is committed to not only developing this expertise within Government, but through a thriving and robust civil society which can provide valuable research and challenge to Government on these issues. The Nuclear Deterrence Fund is a £3.3m pilot programme which will run between FY24-27 to stimulate wider UK expertise in nuclear deterrence issues and to generate a research base to support nuclear deterrence policymaking. The Fund seeks to support the following objectives: 

i.	Promote innovative, high quality and impactful research in nuclear deterrence aligned with HMG priorities. 
ii.	Improve and sustain the generation and use of evidence to address UK nuclear deterrence policy challenges and effectively embed research within deterrence
iii. Support institutions to attract, develop, and retain early- and mid-career researchers within the UK.
iv. Support the formation of a more equal, diverse and inclusive nuclear deterrence research workforce.
v. Establish enduring and sustainable structures of engagement and knowledge exchange between nuclear deterrence researchers and policymakers. 

The Fund will open for proposals between October 2024 and January 2027. A Programme Board comprised of x-HMG officials will review project proposals monthly in FY24/25. The frequency of future Board meetings will be published in due course. Funding decisions will be communicated within four weeks of each Board meeting.

In order to submit proposals to the Nuclear Deterrence Fund, suppliers must register for the Nuclear Deterrence Fund PQQ on the Defence Sourcing Portal (DSP). Once the necessary due diligence checks have been completed, suppliers will be onboarded onto a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) which will provide the overarching contractual terms. Suppliers will have the opportunity to onboard onto the DPS at any time between September 2024 and January 2027. Once on the DPS, suppliers can submit research project proposals for consideration.

This MDA is facilitated by the Royal Navy Maritime Domain Awareness Programme (RN MDAP).

JMSC provides the UK's maritime Common Operating Picture (COP) to all non-Defence users through the RN MDAP. The COP provides accurate and timely situational awareness to decision makers across government and operational agencies. Delivery of the COP requires a layered, pervasive, and non-pervasive data collection capability at multiple fixed and mobile sites to deliver accurate and timely information about users and activities within the UK Marine Area. The data layer from shore-based systems is limited to a few tens of miles from the sensor installations hence there are large areas of the UK Exclusive Economic Zone (UKEEZ) that require alternative aerial surveillance to provide data to the COP. The aerial surveillance is the subject of this notice. A map of the UK EEZ is available here https://data.admiralty.co.uk/portal/apps/sites/#/marine-data-portal.

To date the JMSC has utilised the services of the Maritime and Coast Guard Agency and Marine Scotland to acquire aerial surveillance data.  However, the JMSC is now seeking to engage with a commercial aviation organisation to replace this current arrangement and provide the JMSC with the required levels of aerial surveillance as a fully managed service, including day and night imagery covering the UK EEZ.

The aerial surveillance service provider will be expected to perform covert and non-covert surveillance sorties across all areas of the UK EEZ using either rotary, fixed wing manned or unmanned aircraft to locate and identify targets including vessels that are not broadcasting an Identification Signal. Aircraft sensor fit shall include Radar and Electro Optical Infrared (EO/IR) with cost-effective communication systems to allow the provision of the surveillance data to the JMSC in as near real time as practicable.

The potential length of this contract will be 3 to 5 years in total (including any extension periods), with an estimated total value of up to £19 million if the contract is awarded for 5 years.

The purpose of this market engagement is to assess the interest and capability of the market to meet the requirement and is not a call for competition and as such potential providers will need to express an interest in any future tender opportunity once a notice is published in Contracts Finder. It should also be noted that this notice invites individuals and organisations to express an interest in this market engagement exercise only and is NOT part of any pre-qualification or selection process.

The service can then support people through the early stages of criminal system pathway, refer them for appropriate health or social care or enable them to be diverted away from the criminal justice system into a more appropriate setting, if relevant. The service aims to improve overall health outcomes for people and to support people in the reduction of re-offending. It also aims to identify vulnerabilities in people earlier on which reduces the likelihood that people will reach a crisis-point and helps to ensure the right support can be put in place from the start. 

The service model has four distinct steps - identification, screening, assessment and referral to other services. For those who need additional support, the service will have a community outreach team consisting of community link and peer support workers. 

The service will also share appropriate information with criminal justice partners (Police, Crown Prosecution Service, the judiciary both Crown and Magistrates, defence community and Probation) to help inform their decision making.
 
The service would be expected to work closely with relevant health services across London including Mental Health Treatment Requirement providers, Substance Misuse Services, Housing and accommodation providers, women services etc. The service will work with the Metropolitan Police Service, City of London Police and British Transport Police across London and be based in all their custody suites; it will also be based in all the London Magistrates' Courts and Crown Courts during their operating hours.
